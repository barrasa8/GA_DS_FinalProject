    "\n",
    "A web-based application, is used by University's staff members, students and  agencies. At the moment there we keep track on How many active users are connected every month, but there is no forecasting model in place to predict active users in the following weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** The intention of this notebook is to, using time series, create a model that can predict the active users in the following week.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:** Since the web application is deployed in the cloud, being able to predict active users, could have an impact in how effectively cloud services are provisioned and adjusted to the demand. It could potentially save some money for the company. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:** Based on University placements created, a seasonality component and the number of active users in the previous period, we could predict a higher or lower number of active users."
